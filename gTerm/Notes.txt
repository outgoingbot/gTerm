I need to fix how we connect to the Serial port. Much of it is done automatically at launch, this needs to occur on connect.
-I can create all the serial objects but I want to Connect and start the Thread when I connect.
-I want to Stop the Thread and Disconnect when I click Disconnect button


I need to fuzz the serial port hard and make sure im getting good performance
-some issues that could cause performance drop is:
--Poor buffer handeling
--excessive sleeps in the thread (using sleep to limit CPU usage.)

Have an issue where when I CreateFile for the hSerial it throws error code 5
-ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED (5)	<-- Solved was opening two terminal windows but only drawing one. Only 1 Terminal per Comm Port
